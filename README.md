This repository contains code for the project titled 'Investigation of Spatiotemporal Summation of Excitatory Inputs in a Biophysical Model of the CA1 Pyramidal Neuron', completed for the partial fulfillment of the master's degree. The following implementations have been made through this code in this study.
1. Development and validation of the Biophysically detailed CA1 pyramidal Neuron. (CA1-model-0625)
2. Investigation of the Summation of Excitatory Inputs to the Model CA1 Pyramidal Neuron.
3. To develop the Plateau Potential through Input Pathways interactions to the CA1 Neuron.
